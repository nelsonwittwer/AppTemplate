==To get a new rails app started, do this stuff:

Rename your app using this fancy plugin
rails g rename_to SweetNewName

Then, delete the plugin
rm -r "vendor/plugins/Rename"

Then edit your database.yml file with the app name for the names of each database

Then run rake db:create:all

Then, Code like a monkey
